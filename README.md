# Food_Delivery-shipping-service

### The project
This repository is the code base of Shipping service - a part of my Food Delivery Application system that applies GeoHash into Shipper searching business.
My main goal on the project so far is to create a proof-of-concept system design for geo-proximity searching based on GeoHash library. Therefore, I just simplified
other things, e.g: shipper management, order management,... Maybe I will extend those features if I find things worth to try.


### The geo-searching problem
Nowadays, the need for searching nearby object has seen an enormous rise, especially in recent years with the prevalence of food delivery apps, social apps, booking apps 
and etc. It poses a challenge of delivering solution that is efficient in both time and space, meaning that we demand a search feature to be able to find the most outcomes in the least period.
The challenge is more difficult for big system because the scalability and availability are always the most vital criteria.
